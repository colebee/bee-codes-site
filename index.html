            <h2>About Fitness Roguelite</h2>
            <p>Fitness Roguelite is an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) mobile app that gamifies your fitness journey. By integrating with wearables like Garmin, it turns real-world activities—such as steps, workouts, and heart rate data—into procedural rogue-like adventures. Explore dungeons based on your daily steps, battle mobs with resistance training stats, and recover with rest data.</p>
            <p>This app is in early development as a prototype to validate the concept, with plans for commercial launch. For privacy details, see our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
